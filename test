There once lived two brothers named Ali Baba and
Cassim. They came from a very poor family. Both of the
brothers were married. Ali Baba lived with his poor wife in
a small house. He had to cut down trees to sell in the
marketplace for money. Cassim lived in a big house
because he married a rich girl. Her family had a lot of
money. That was why Cassim married her. Cassim was a
selfish person and he did not want to share his money
with his poor brother.
One day, while Ali Baba was working in the woods, he
heard some noise. He saw horsemen running toward him
into the forest. He was afraid, so he climbed up a tree to
hide. He saw forty men running into the forest with big
bags on their backs and on their horses. He could see and
hear everything down below. The forty men were standing
beside a large stone. The leader of the group went to the
stone and said in a loud voice, “Open Sesame!”
The stone moved revealing a door way. All of the men
went inside the cave with the bags on their backs. Inside
the bags were gold and other precious stones. They put
the bags inside the cave and went out. The leader shouted
out, “Close Sesame!” The stone door closed. All the men
went home.
